            Potatoes in a Pot
            <sub style="font-size: 8px">by Oliver O'Conner</sub>
          </h2>
          <section>
            <p>
              In the bustling town of Greenwick, where farmers' markets and
              artisanal goods thrived, a quirky entrepreneur named Oliver
              O'Conner was about to change the way people thought about potatoes
              forever.
            </p>
            <p>
              Oliver had always been a lover of <em>comfort food</em>, and
              nothing was more comforting than a warm, homegrown potato. But as
              a city dweller with little space for a garden, he often found
              himself frustrated by the lack of fresh, homegrown produce. One
              evening, while absentmindedly staring at a half-eaten baked
              potato, he had a revelation:
              <q>
                "What if people could grow their own potatoesâ€”right in their own
                kitchen, with no farm, no fuss?"
              </q>
            </p>
            <p>
              And so,
              <strong>
                Pot at Oâ€™s was bornâ€”a business dedicated to selling
                self-growing, pre-planted potatoes in biodegradable pots.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Each pot came with nutrient-rich soil and a special potato variety
              that could thrive indoors. All customers had to do was water it,
              wait a few weeks, and then harvest their own fresh, homegrown
              potatoes. Oliverâ€™s catchy business name had two meanings: "Pot at
              Oâ€™s" (as in, a pot of potatoes from Oliverâ€™s place) and a playful
              pun that delighted customers. Soon, the product became a viral
              sensation.
